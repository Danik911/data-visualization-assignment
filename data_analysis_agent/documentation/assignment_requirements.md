**Description of the Assignment**

**Data Visualization and Storytelling**

**April 2025**

1.  **Purpose**

The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate and grade the skills of the learners of the module Data Visualization and Storytelling to visualize and describe the outputs.

1.  **Data Resources**

The dataset provided, consists of the attributes and price for over 2400 houses, and the location information in the United States.

The purpose of gathering such dataset is to evaluate the association between the housing price, the attributes of houses, and their locations. Such data would ultimately provide the buyers, sellers, investors, and other stakeholders in better understanding of the housing market.

1.  **Assignment Deliverables**

The module participants are required to create and design a dashboard using one of the visualization tools that were discussed during the module sessions (or other tools of their choice, as long as the chosen tool provides the same capacity of creating a dashboard for visualization and analysis).

The dashboard is expected to consist of a couple of graphs and tables to address various angles and variables of the datasets, along with appropriate utilization of a couple of filters to allow the user to monitor the housing price based on various attributes of houses.

In addition, the module participants are required to deliver a maximum 10-page document consisting of the screenshots of the created dashboard and the story regarding the graphs/tables presented.

**Marking Scheme**



**Academic Integrity**

As defined in QAE J6 Academic Misconduct Procedure:

**_Plagiarism:_** _Plagiarism includes copying or incorporating material derived from pre-existing work (published or unpublished) without the permission of the originator or without an established form of acknowledgement. It includes verbatim quotation, paraphrasing, imitation or other devices, which give the impression of being a learner’s original work. It also includes the exploitation of ideas from others without proper acknowledgement, which mostly occurs in research, project work or assignments._

This allegation, if found to be true, represents a case of **Academic Misconduct** under Griffith College Rules.

As per the procedure, the penalty for Minor Academic Misconduct, which has taken place for the first time: The learner is given zero in that element of the coursework that was proved to have resulted from academic misconduct. The learner must resubmit only that element of the coursework in which academic misconduct was detected. The result in that element of coursework shall be capped at 40%. If the learner does not resubmit the element within the prescribed timeframe, he / she shall receive a fail result for the entire piece of coursework. A record of the offence will be held internally.

You must include your watermark (name) in the document to prove it is original.

Examples of plagiarism in this assignment could include, but are not limited to,

*   Submitting an infographic that is not entirely your own work. The infographic must be constructed by you.
*   Submitting screenshots only of infographics that cannot be edited if requested to do so.
*   Submitting an infographic that is constructed from more than one existing infographics.
*   Submitting an infographic from another student/work colleague.
*   Submitting an infographic which is part of a work initiative or project from your place of work or other business – corporate plagiarism.
*   Submitting a reference list that is not of your own making – copying an existing reference list from another source.
*   Submitting a video that is not of your own making. This includes voice overs from other sources.
*   Submitting work that has been completed by others – thesis factories, online help sites, collaboration with others.

Learners must include Harvard referencing & citation. [See the library website for guidance](https://library.griffith.ie/academic-integrity/writing-skills/referencing-styles/).

**AI in Learner Assessment Policy**

Learners must embrace Academic Integrity as a key element of their education path. Learners must make sure they understand the standard they are being held to. This includes becoming aware of and adhering to Griffith College policies such as the AI in Learner Assessment Policy.

[Refer to the AI in Learner Assessment Policy for more information](https://www.griffith.ie/sites/default/files/2025-03/f-6.5-ai-in-learner-assessment-policy.pdf)

*   All AI generated content and process must be declared.
*   Any task that is not listed as permitted may be assumed to be prohibited.
*   If it is determined that a learner has used an AI tool in any way that is not permitted by the chosen level, then they will be subject to the disciplinary procedures listed in the Academic Integrity and Misconduct policy regarding the misuse of AI in assignments.

Listed below are the levels of AI permitted in this assessment.

| Level 0All AI prohibited | The use of any AI tool (online or locally hosted) is not permitted for any part of an assessment. This includes closed book and time-bound examination settings. |
| --- | --- |
| Level 1 AI to form ideas, structure, and research | AI tools may be used at the planning stage of an assignment. All AI use must be declared. Learners must add an appendix showing the ideas, structures, and recommended research given by an AI. Acceptable use in this level is defined as: Idea generation: Using AI to generate suggestions on specific topics that could be included in their assessment. The learner would then have to research and create the assignment content without AI assistance. Structure: Asking AI to give an overview or to plan how to discuss the topic of the assignment (e.g. a short bullet point list). The learner would be required to take that list and expand it into a full assignment without further assistance from the AI. Research: Asking AI for references to appropriate sources that discuss the topic. Learners would then be required to evaluate those references. If any of the references are relevant to the assignment it should then be cited in the assignment work. AI summaries of any source is not permitted. All AI use must be declared. |
| Level 2 AI to document edit and improve written quality | AI tools may be used to improve the written quality of an assignment. A learner who uses AI in this way would be required to cite how and where AI editing was use. Acceptable use in this level is defined as: Synonyms to words and phrases: Using AI for alternative suggestions for a word or phrase. A learner could also ask an AI if a word or phrase exists for a concept they are trying to communicate. Grammar checking: Asking AI to perform grammar checking on sentences or short paragraphs (< 200 words) and provide suggestions on how to update or change the content to better communicate the idea in said sentences or paragraphs. All AI use must be declared. |
| Level 3 AI for partial task completion | AI tools may be used to perform certain tasks in the assignment. The tasks that AI tools may be used for in this level may be considered menial, mechanical, or tedious, and not a direct contribution to a learning outcome. Learners are expected to clearly declare which tasks of their assignment have been AI generated. Examples of such tasks would be (but not limited to, as it varies from discipline to discipline): Sample dataset generation: Datasets for a given assignment may not exist, or exist in low sample count and/or poor quality versions. AI can be used to create sample datasets. If such a dataset is created it is clearly declared in the assignment. Basic data analysis: summaries and basic statistics of data for further analysis by the learner. Template creation: AI generates a visual organisation of how information would be presented. Image annotation: AI generates alternative text and captions to describe what images and visuals are depicting. All AI use must be declared. |
| Level 4AI task completion with human evaluation | AI is used to complete certain elements of the task (to express part of the learning outcomes), with learners providing discussion, analysis or commentary on the AI-generated content. This level requires critical engagement with AI generated content and evaluating its output. You will use AI to complete specified tasks in your assessment. All AI use must be declared. |
