Place your screenshot images in this folder so they render in the main README.

Expected filenames referenced by the root README.md:
- filters-panel.png
- overview-metrics.png
- map-property-tooltip.png
- price-vs-area.png

Tip: Use PNG at around 1200–1600px width for clarity on GitHub. Keep file sizes reasonable (<1–2 MB) for fast loading.
