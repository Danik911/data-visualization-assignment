**Description of the Assignment**

**Data Visualization and Storytelling**

**April 2025**

1. **Purpose**

The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate and grade the skills of the learners of the module Data Visualization and Storytelling to visualize and describe the outputs.

1. **Data Resources**

The dataset provided, consists of the attributes and price for over 2400 houses, and the location information in the United States.

The purpose of gathering such dataset is to evaluate the association between the housing price, the attributes of houses, and their locations. Such data would ultimately provide the buyers, sellers, investors, and other stakeholders in better understanding of the housing market.

1. **Assignment Deliverables**

The module participants are required to create and design a dashboard using one of the visualization tools that were discussed during the module sessions (or other tools of their choice, as long as the chosen tool provides the same capacity of creating a dashboard for visualization and analysis).

The dashboard is expected to consist of a couple of graphs and tables to address various angles and variables of the datasets, along with appropriate utilization of a couple of filters to allow the user to monitor the housing price based on various attributes of houses.

In addition, the module participants are required to deliver a maximum 10-page document consisting of the screenshots of the created dashboard and the story regarding the graphs/tables presented.
